# Sharktest

Programs for testing Megalodon.

## How It Works

Inspired by Stockfish's Fishtest, this is a server-client system that allows
you to use your CPU and run one of the tests.

## How To Use

Download the client Python file (`src/client.py`).
You will need Python 3 and packages defined in `requirements.txt`

Run the client file, and enter the IP address defined below.

Next, enter the number of cores you wish to use.
The more cores you use, the more games you will contribute,
but your computer will become slower.

## Server IP

There is currently no official server for Sharktest.

The Megalodon team will start hosting a server on March 28, 2021.
