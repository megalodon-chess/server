# Sharktest

Programs for testing Megalodon.

## How It Works

Inspired by Stockfish's Fishtest, this is a server-client system that allows
you to use your CPU and test Megalodon parameters.

## How To Use

Download the client Python file (`src/client.py`).
You will need Python 3 and packages defined in `requirements.txt`

Run the client file, and follow the directions.

## Server IP

There is currently no official server for Sharktest.

The Megalodon team will start hosting a server on March 28, 2021.
