# Evalweights

Tuning Megalodon's evaluation.

**Still in development**

## About

The client will create two instances of Megalodon.

The first instance will use the default Megalodon evaluation settings,
and the second will have random settings for each evaluation category (except material).

Then, the two instances will play 20 games against each other, and the results are sent to the server.
